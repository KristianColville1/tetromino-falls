## Project Goals
Design an interactive game that takes advantage of a [command line interface](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Command-line_interface). It should be highly attractive and visually pleasing to the user of the terminal game. 
The game needs is expected to run within a terminal so should be built to take advantage of this scenario.
The project should be deployed to Heroku. The expectation is that python is used throughout.
